abstract = {A wide variety of data sets produced by individual investigators are now synthesized to address ecological questions that span a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is important to facilitate such syntheses so that ''consumers'' of data sets can be confident that both input data sets and synthetic products are reliable. Necessary documentation to ensure the reliability and validation of data sets includes both familiar descriptive metadata and formal documentation of the scientific processes used (i.e., process metadata) to produce usable data sets from collections of raw data. Such documentation is complex and difficult to construct, so it is important to help ''producers'' create reliable data sets and to facilitate their creation of required metadata. We describe a formal representation, an ''analytic web,'' that aids both producers and consumers of data sets by providing complete and precise definitions of scientific processes used to process raw and derived data sets. The formalisms used to define analytic webs are adaptations of those used in software engineering, and they provide a novel and effective support system for both the synthesis and the validation of ecological data sets. We illustrate the utility of an analytic web as an aid to producing synthetic data sets through a worked example: the synthesis of long-term measurements of whole-ecosystem carbon exchange. Analytic webs are also useful validation aids for consumers because they support the concurrent construction of a complete, Internet-accessible audit trail of the analytic processes used in the synthesis of the data sets. Finally we describe our early efforts to evaluate these ideas through the use of a prototype software tool, SciWalker. We indicate how this tool has been used to create analytic webs tailored to specific data-set synthesis and validation activities, and suggest extensions to it that will support additional forms of validation. The process metadata created by SciWalker is readily adapted for inclusion in Ecological Metadata Language (EML) files.},

With this understanding, stabilizing structures at different levels of the ecological hierarchy can be identified and any population-, community-, or ecosystem-level structures that mute energy or material flow also stabilize systems dynamics. McCann uses this powerful general framework to discuss the effects of human impact on the stability and sustainability of ecological systems, and he demonstrates that there is clear empirical evidence that the structures supporting ecological systems have been dangerously eroded.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Uniting the latest research on food webs with classical theories, this book will be a standard source in the understanding of natural food web functions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Indirect effects, the ability of one element in a system to impact another without direct interaction, are critical components of complex adaptive systems. Network environ analysis (NEA) is an environmental extension of economic input???output analysis that characterizes and quantifies indirect effects transmitted by a specific currency (e.g., carbon, nitrogen) within a steady state system. Previous {\{}NEA{\}} results suggest that indirect effects tend to dominate direct effects in ecosystems. Although steady state models may be useful, ecologists are often interested in system dynamics. In this article, we use {\{}NEA{\}} to investigate the temporal dynamics of indirect effects in 16 steady state models of nitrogen cycling in the Neuse River Estuary, USA. These models were originally constructed by Christian and Thomas [Christian, R.R., Thomas, C.R., 2003. Network analysis of nitrogen inputs and cycling in the Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. Estuaries 26, 815???828]. Our work had two primary objectives: (1) describe and quantify the temporal dynamics of indirect flows and (2) identify the importance of model factors in determining the magnitude of indirect flows. Our results indicate that indirect flows transmitted by the network of nitrogen transactions, especially microbial transformations, dominated direct flows in the Neuse River Estuary between spring 1985 and winter 1989. When we examined the indirect flow index (ratio of indirect to total system throughflow), we were surprised by the relatively small amount of temporal variation within the Neuse River Estuary. In all seasons, indirect flow was more than 80{\%} of TST, and there was no significant interannual variation. Our analysis also revealed no clear relationship between boundary or direct flow and indirect flow, but a strong association between cycled and indirect flow. We conclude that while an increase in boundary, direct, and cycled flows can influence indirect flows, in the Neuse River Estuary models indirect flows are predominantly due to cycling. If nitrogen loading had been reduced during our study period, this system likely would have remained eutrophic for an extended period of time. If we assume the system remained similar in 1997, we would expect the legislated reduction of nitrogen loading to have little immediate effect, although this action will be important for long-term change. Dominance of indirect flow due to cycling makes this system state relatively difficult to change rapidly by external forcing. In this sense, the indirect effects stabilize the system, making it more resistant to external perturbations, though it may be more sensitive in the long-term. },

A focus on convergent interactions clarifies how natural selection repeatedly favors particular kinds of associations among species. Characterizing convergent interactions in a comparative context is likely to facilitate prediction of the ecological roles of organisms (including microbes) in multispecies interactions and selective pressures acting in poorly understood or newly discovered multispecies systems. We illustrate the concept of convergent interactions with examples: vertebrates and their gut bacteria; ectomycorrhizae; insect–fungal–bacterial interactions; pitcher-plant food webs; and ants and ant–plants.},

abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called 'early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

abstract = {At the dawn of the 21st century, environmental scientists are collecting more data more rapidly than at any time in the past. Nowhere is this change more evident than in the advent of sensor networks able to collect and process (in real time) simultaneous measurements over broad areas and at high sampling rates. At the same time there has been great progress in the development of standards, methods, and tools for data analysis and synthesis, including a new standard for descriptive metadata for ecological datasets (Ecological Metadata Language) and new workflow tools that help scientists to assemble datasets and to diagram, record, and execute analyses. However these developments (important as they are) are not yet sufficient to guarantee the reliability of datasets created by a scientific process - the complex activity that scientists carry out in order to create a dataset. We define a dataset to be reliable when the scientific process used to create it is (1) reproducible and (2) analyzable for potential defects. To address this problem we propose the use of an analytic web, a formal representation of a scientific process that consists of three coordinated graphs (a data-flow graph, a dataset-derivation graph, and a process-derivation graph) originally developed for use in software engineering. An analytic web meets the two key requirements for ensuring dataset reliability: (1) a complete audit trail of all artifacts (e.g., datasets, code, models) used or created in the execution of the scientific process that created the dataset, and (2) detailed process metadata that precisely describe all sub-processes of the scientific process. Construction of such metadata requires the semantic features of a high-level process definition language. In this paper we illustrate the use of an analytic web to represent the scientific process of constructing estimates of ecosystem water flux from data gathered by a complex, real-time multi-sensor network. We use Little-JIL, a high-level process definition language, to precisely and accurately capture the analytical processes involved. We believe that incorporation of this approach into existing tools and evolving metadata specifications (such as EML) will yield significant benefits to science. These benefits include: complete and accurate representations of scientific processes; support for rigorous evaluation of such processes for logical and statistical errors and for propagation of measurement error; and assurance of dataset reliability for developing sound models and forecasts of environmental change. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding how communities respond to changes in temperature is a major challenge for community ecology. Temperature influences the relative degree to which top-down and bottom-up forces structure ecological communities. In greenhouse experiments using the aquatic community found in pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea), I tested how temperature affected the relative importance of top-down (mosquito predation) and bottom-up (ant carcasses) forces on protozoa and bacteria populations. While bottom-up effects did not vary consistently with temperature, the top-down effects of predators on protozoa increased at higher temperatures. These results suggest that temperature could change the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects in ecological communities. Specifically, higher temperature may increase the strength of top-down effects by raising predator metabolic rate and concomitant processes (e.g., activity, foraging, digestion, growth) relative to cooler temperatures. These findings apply broadly to an understanding of trophic interactions in a variable environment and are especially relevant in the context of ongoing climate change.},

abstract = {Ecological engineering operates in those scales of size and time where most people do not believe there are many scientific principles. Because humans are in this scale, they see so much detail that they can not see the organization and often seek non-scientific theories for what happens. Others, including me, believe that all scales of size and time operate according to the same common designs with common principles. By this view, the noisy detail we see around us is the trial and error process of finding what works best, and what works best can be found from scientific principles. Trial and error efforts to find the maximum performance are aided by variation and choices provided by the dynamic oscillations of the smaller scales. Horgan (1995) quotes many scientists who believe some scales have more complexity than others. My view is that all scales have the same complexity, but that humans perceive less as they look towards smaller or larger scales than their own realm. Does the ratio of variance to the mean tend to be constant? Progress in science has been faster at the scales where overview models were encouraged because the complexity was less visible. Mathematical models of ecosystems started with plankton ecosystems where it was easier to see less and think simple as compared to forests where the complexity was visible and intimidating. Fig. 1 shows a typical graph of replacement time and territory of the type now common in all sciences. If ecological engineering is defined as the management of systems of human and environmental self-design, it can be seen to be with environmen-tal science in the territory-time window at the interface between ecosystems and human society. Filg. 2 shows the scales of size and time in an energy systems diagram where components are arranged from left to right in order of their territory-turnover time. In this particular aggregation the design of each scale is the same, and the inter-level},

Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt. },

abstract = {Sea-level rise and frequent intense hurricanes associated with climate change will result in recurrent flooding of inland systems such as Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs by storm surges. These surges can transport salt water and sediment to freshwater bogs, greatly affecting their biological integrity. Purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia rosea) are Gulf Coast pitcher plant bog inhabitants that could be at a disadvantage under this scenario because their pitcher morphology may leave them prone to collection of saline water and sediment after a surge. We investigated the effects of storm surge water salinity and sediment type on S. rosea vitality, plant community structure, and bog soil-water conductivity. Plots (containing {\textgreater}/=1 ramet of S. rosea) were experimentally flooded with fresh or saline water crossed with one of three sediment types (local, foreign, or no sediment). There were no treatment effects on soil-water conductivity; nevertheless, direct exposure to saline water resulted in significantly lower S. rosea cover until the following season when a prescribed fire and regional drought contributed to the decline of all the S. rosea to near zero percent cover. There were also significant differences in plant community structure between treatments over time, reflecting how numerous species increased in abundance and a few species decreased in abundance. However, in contrast to S. rosea, most of the other species in the community appeared resilient to the effects of storm surge. Thus, although the community may be somewhat affected by storm surge, those few species that are particularly sensitive to the storm surge disturbance will likely drop out of the community and be replaced by more resilient species. Depending on the longevity of these biological legacies, Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs may be incapable of fully recovering if they become exposed to storm surge more frequently due to climate change.},

These results imply that the number and area of coastal ecosystems affected by hypoxia and the future extent of hypoxia impacts on marine life have been generally underestimated.},

abstract = {Carnivory in plants has developed as an evolutionary adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. A significant investment of the resources of a carnivorous plant is committed to producing the traps, attractants, and digestive enzymes needed for the carnivory. The cost:benefit ratio of carnivory can be improved by either maximizing the prey capture rate or by reducing the metabolic commitment toward carnivory. Using the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea, we have investigated whether the expression of the hydrolytic enzymes needed for digestion is regulated in response to the presence of prey. Expression of protease, RNase, nuclease, and phosphatase activities could be induced in the fluid of nonactive traps by the addition of nucleic acids, protein, or reduced nitrogen, suggesting that hydrolase expression is induced upon perception of the appropriate chemical signal. Hydrolase expression was also developmentally controlled since expression commenced upon opening of a trap, increased for several days, and in the absence of prey largely ceased within 2 weeks. Nevertheless, the traps remained competent to induce expression in response to the appropriate signals. These data suggest that in young traps hydrolase expression is developmentally regulated, which is later replaced by a signal transduction mechanism, and they demonstrate the ability of a carnivorous species to respond to the availability of resources},

These studies combine the microcosm advantages of small size, short generation times, contained structure and hierarchical spatial arrangement with advantages of field studies: natural environmental variance, 'openness' and realistic species combinations with shared evolutionary histories. This enables tests of theory pertaining to spatial and temporal dynamics, for example, the effects of neighboring communities on local diversity, or the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function. Using examples, we comment on the position of natural microcosms in the roster of ecological research strategies and tools. We conclude that natural microcosms are as versatile as artificial microcosms, but as complex and biologically realistic as other natural systems. Research to date combined with inherent attributes of natural microcosms make them strong candidate model systems for ecology.},

abstract = {The assembly of local communities from regional pools is a multifaceted process that involves the confluence of interactions and environmental conditions at the local scale and biogeographic and evolutionary history at the regional scale. Understanding the relative influence of these factors on community structure has remained a challenge and mechanisms driving community assembly are often inferred from patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, community assembly is often viewed through the lens of competition and rarely includes trophic interactions or entire food webs. Here, we use motifs – subgraphs of nodes (e.g. species) and links (e.g. predation) whose abundance within a network deviates significantly as compared to a random network topology – to explore the assembly of food web networks found in the leaves of the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. We compared counts of three-node motifs across a hierarchy of scales to a suite of null models to determine if motifs are over-, under-, or randomly represented. We then assessed if the pattern of representation of a motif in a given network matched that of the network it was assembled from. We found that motif representation in over 70{\%} of site networks matched the continental network they were assembled from and over 75{\%} of local networks matched the site networks they were assembled from for the majority of null models. This suggests that the same processes are shaping networks across scales. To generalize our results and effectively use a motif perspective to study community assembly, a theoretical framework detailing potential mechanisms for all possible combinations of motif representation is necessary.},

In these global relationships, the half-saturation constant Km, i.e. the resource availability at which half of the maximum intake is reached, determines the outcome of models and may contribute to explain behavioral traits, life-strategies and species occurrence. As macroecological data on this parameter are rather scarce, our investigation aims (1) to provide an overview of the half-saturation constants reported in literature and (2) to explore the consistency of the data with the body size trait. First, a meta-analysis was conducted on reviews and original studies published in literature. Second, the half-saturation constants obtained for several groups were linked to body size. In total, 338 half-saturation constants were collected from bacteria to ungulates, showing that the half-saturation reflects less than expected body size. Individual body size is not the dominant predictor determining the half-saturation constant, in contrast to interacting resource and consumer's sizes which are crucial to understand the variability of functional responses.},
